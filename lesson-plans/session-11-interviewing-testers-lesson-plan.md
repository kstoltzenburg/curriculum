# Session 11 - Interviewing testers - Lesson plan

## **Learning objectives**

By the end of the session students will be able to:

* Describe different processes for conducting interviews
* Define different types of questions to investigate the candidate’s knowledge, skills, experience and attitude.

### **Before the session**

Students will be recommended to view the following videos:

* Being interviewed - To be built

        <p>Break in to the small groups again.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>The testing challenge is as follows:</p>
        <p>“How many golf balls can you fit onto a yellow school bus?”</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Mentors, let the students conduct this challenge together as a small group.
          <br
          />
        </p>
        <p>Although this puzzle appears to be a logic puzzle, the objective of using
          this puzzle in a testing interview is to test the candidate’s lateral and
          critical thinking skills.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>The expectation is that the students will ask lots of questions and point
          out as many risks as they can regarding the objective of squeezing as many
          golf balls onto a bus.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>Hopefully the students will discuss the variables of what “golf ball”
          means (there are many types of golf balls), and what is meant by “bus”
          (there are many types of school buses too, which vary even by location).
          Even the properties of the inside of a bus can be challenged (number of
          seats, thickness and durability of the windows, number of people on board,
          are any doors/windows open, is the bus parked on a slope, etc).</p>

# Session 9 - Automation - Lesson plan

## **Learning objectives**

By the end of the session students will be able to:

* Describe what automation is within the context of software testing
* Break down an application to discover automation opportunities
* Describe the different characteristics of automated checks
* Choose specific tools for specific problems that can contribute to a successful automation strategy

### **Before the session**

Students will be recommended to view the following videos:

* Automation - [https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/99-second-introduction-to-automation](https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/99-second-introduction-to-automation)

        <p>Enhances testers both in a positive and negative way

        <p>When students come up with ideas, encourage them to explore the idea deeply.
          What could be the opposite to what they are saying? What ways could their
          ideas impact other testing activities?

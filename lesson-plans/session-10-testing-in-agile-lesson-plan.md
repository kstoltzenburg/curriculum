# Session 10 - Testing in agile - Lesson plan

## **Learning objectives**

By the end of the session students will be able to:

* Describe the concepts of agile and how it affects software development
* Define different types of approaches found in agile teams
* Define what a test strategy and test plan is
* Collect information about their current working context
* Choose testing activities to form a test strategy based on information about their current working context

### **Before the session**

Students will be recommended to view the following videos:

* Test Strategies / Test Plans - To be built

### **Schedule**
